Attempting to Predict OPS using Early-Season Metrics

Using batted ball data from Baseball Savant, I attempted to predict end of season OPS. I used data from the 2025 MLB season, using only players who had recorded 40 plate apperances by April 30th. I used batted ball data from Baseball Savant, found OPS on Baseball-Reference, and coded in RStudio, using a variety of packages. I found the most successful model to be the model that used exit velocity and barrel rate to predict OPS.
